## A UI Mod for Age of Empires Definitive Edition
An UI for 4k UltraWide monitor based on Redi UI 3.. The UI focus all the elements on the bottom left, center to have a simple view at everything.
It uses transparent backgrounds for the panels.

I made it for myself on a 4K monitor, I haven't try it on other resolutions.

If you want to change the position, sizes or even images this information will help you: Roles of json files: commandpanel.json - the main panel mappanel.json - minimap resourcepanel.json - res bar scorepanel.json - playersâ€™ scores during the game technologyprogresspanel.json - unit queue If you want to see the changes without having to reload the game then you need to put there everything apart from .json files into a local mod folder. So generally graphics into its own local mod. Then you edit corresponding .json files in your game folder. This way you can see the changes live.

Enjoy! Best Regards, Daniel Azar
